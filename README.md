# Minesweeper

This project operates similarily to a VT100 in that it uses a memory to specify the foreground and background color of each cell of the 10 x 10 display. This project also utilizes a Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO) which is a 2-D array data structure, where the cell display is dependent on a half-word of information.
